# üëÅÔ∏è HiveMind

The HiveMind module serves as the brain of the swarm. It examines the current
state of each owned room and queues tasks into the Hierarchical Task Management
(HTM) system. Logic is split into **modules** so each concern can evaluate
independently.

## Responsibilities

- Analyse rooms for threats or opportunities
- Push colony level tasks such as `defendRoom` or `upgradeController`
- Queue spawn orders for the `spawnManager`, including panic bootstrap tasks
- Keep logic isolated from task execution by delegating to HTM

## Example Usage
```javascript
const hivemind = require('manager.hivemind');
scheduler.addTask('hivemind', 1, () => hivemind.run());
```

This lightweight decision layer can be expanded with more complex strategies
over time. The default `spawn` module handles panic bootstrap and miner
evaluation. A small ‚Äúsubconscious‚Äù checks each tick and only runs a module when
its queue is empty.

## Modules

- **spawn** ‚Äì Maintains the workforce. Miners are requested based on available
  mining spots and work parts (typically three per source at RCL1). Haulers are
  requested in a 1:1 ratio with other roles early on and taper to 1:2 as the
  colony grows. Upgraders are capped at eight. Builders are limited to four per
  construction site with a hard maximum of twelve. When no creeps remain the
  queue is purged and a bootstrap worker
  is scheduled so the colony can recover.
  Modules can be added later for building, defense or expansion logic.
  The HiveMind also orders basic infrastructure:
  - Containers are planned as soon as the room is claimed (RCL1).
  - Extensions begin construction when the controller reaches RCL2.
  - Source containers are prioritized before extensions, followed by controller
    and buffer containers.
  - Mining positions are freed when miners approach expiry so replacements
    can claim the same spot. Any leftover reservations are cleared when
    miners or allPurpose creeps die.
  - Restricted tiles around the spawn are stored in room memory so creeps avoid
    blocking it.

## Failsafe Memory Initialization

After a respawn or unexpected memory wipe the HiveMind may lack the data needed
to plan tasks. When required sections such as `rooms` or `hive` are missing it
logs a severity 5 message and schedules a one-time high priority task to
recreate the baseline memory. The room is rescanned and HiveMind evaluations
resume on the following tick.
