# HUD Layout Progress

If `Memory.settings.debugLayoutProgress` is `true`, the layout planner and building manager
log cluster progress every 1000 ticks. Example console line:

```
[cluster] W1N1:extCluster1 3/5
```

This indicates three of the five planned structures in `extCluster1` have been built.
